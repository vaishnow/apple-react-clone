          1. Offer valid on qualifying purchases of Eligible Products from
          November 24, 2023, to November 27, 2023, at a Qualifying Location.
          Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Qualifying
          purchasers can receive a discount equal to the value of the Promotion
          Product (depending on their purchase) off the price of the Eligible
          Product, but will be charged for all items in their cart. Important
          notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple
          Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: A
          purchase of an Eligible Product made when selecting ACMI (a 0% APR
          payment option available only in the U.S.) as the payment type at
          checkout will receive an instant credit equal to the cost of the
          Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) deducted from the price of the
          Eligible Product at the time of purchase. You will be charged one ACMI
          installment plan for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant
          credit. The value of the Promotion Product (i.e., the value of the
          Apple Gift Card) will also be charged in a separate second ACMI
          installment plan for the same number of months as the discounted
          Eligible Product. The total combined amount charged over the 2
          separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail
          price of the Eligible Product. Separately, you will receive and be
          charged for the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) in the amount of
          the applicable instant credit. ACMI is a 0% APR payment option that is
          only available if you select it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible
          Apple products purchased at Apple Store locations, apple.com, the
          Apple Store app, or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to
          credit approval and credit limit. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204
          for more information about eligible products. APR ranges may vary
          based on when you accepted an Apple Card. Cardholders who accept an
          Apple Card on and/or after August 10, 2023: Variable APRs for Apple
          Card, other than ACMI, range from 19.24% to 29.49% based on
          creditworthiness. Rates as of August 10, 2023. Existing cardholders:
          See your Customer Agreement for applicable rates and fee. If you buy
          an ACMI-eligible product by choosing to pay in full with Apple Card
          (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject to the Apple Card
          variable APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI purchases are
          subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR. You’ll need to select AT&T,
          T-Mobile, or Verizon as your carrier when you check out. An iPhone
          purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at
          any time. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the
          following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating
          corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small
          businesses; Government, and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs,
          or on refurbished devices. The last month’s payment for each product
          will be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the
          monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is subject to change at any
          time for any reason, including but not limited to, installment term
          lengths and eligible products. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for
          information about upcoming changes to ACMI financing. See the Apple
          Card Customer Agreement for more information about ACMI financing.
